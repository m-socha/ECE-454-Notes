  \section{Introduction}
    \subsection{What is a Distributed System?}
      A distributed system is a collection of autonomous computing elements that appear to its users to be a single coherent system.

    \subsection{Rationale Behind Distributed Systems}
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Resource sharing
        \item Integrating multiple systems
        \item Centralized systems may not be as effective as many smaller systems working together
        \item Users themselves may be mobile and distributed physically from one another
      \end{itemize}

    \subsection{Middleware}
      Middleware is a layer of software that separates applications from their underlying platform. Middleware is often used by distributed
      systems to support heterogeneous computers and networks while offering a single-system view. Common middleware services include:
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Communication (e.g. add job to remote queue)
        \item Transactions (e.g. access multiple independent services atomically)
        \item Service composition (e.g. Independent map system enhanced with independent weather forecast system)
        \item Reliability (e.g. replicated state machine)
      \end{itemize}

    \subsection{Goals of Distributed Systems}
      \subsubsection{Supporting Resource Sharing}
        Resources can include:
        \begin{itemize}
          \item Peripheral devices (e.g. printers, video cameras)
          \item Storage facilities (e.g. file servers)
          \item Enterprise data (e.g. payroll)
          \item Web page (e.g. Web search)
          \item CPUs (e.g. Supercomputers)
        \end{itemize}

      \subsubsection{Making distribution transparent}
        Distribution transparency attempts to hide that processes and resources are physically distributed. Types of transparency include:
        \begin{itemize}
          \item \textbf{Access:} Hide differences in data representation and how data is accessed
          \item \textbf{Location:} Hide where resource is located
          \item \textbf{Migration:} Hide that a resource may move to another location
          \item \textbf{Relocation:} Hide that a resource may move to another location while in use
          \item \textbf{Replication:} Hide that a resource is replicated
          \item \textbf{Concurrency:} Hide that a resource may be shared by users competing for that resource
          \item \textbf{Failure:} Hide the failure and recovery of a resource
        \end{itemize}

      \subsubsection{Being Open}
        An open distributed system offers components that can be easily used by or integrated into other systems. Key properties of openness
        include:
        \begin{itemize}
          \item Interoperability
          \item Composability
          \item Extensibility
          \item Separation of policy from mechanism
        \end{itemize}

      \subsubsection{Being Scalable}
        Scalability covers a system's ability to expand along three axes:
        \begin{itemize}
          \item Size (e.g. adding users and resources)
          \item Geography (e.g. users across large distances)
          \item Administration (e.g. multiple independent admins)
        \end{itemize}
        Centralized systems tend to have limited scalability.

        A few common scaling techniques include:
        \begin{itemize}
          \item Hiding communication latencies (i.e. trying to avoid waiting for responses from remote-server machines)
          \item Partitioning (i.e. Taking a component, splitting it into smaller parts, and spreading those parts across the system)
          \item Replication (i.e. Adding multiple copies of a component to increase availability, balance load, support caching, etc.)
        \end{itemize}

      \subsection{Common Fallacies of Distributed Computing}
        The following are common beginner assumptions that can lead to major trouble:
        \begin{itemize}
          \item The network is reliable
          \item The network is secure
          \item The network is homogeneous
          \item The network topology is static
          \item Latency is 0
          \item Bandwidth is unlimited
          \item Transport cost is 0
          \item There is one administrator
        \end{itemize}

      \subsection{Types of Distributed Systems}
        \begin{itemize}
          \item \textbf{Web sites and Web services}
          \item \textbf{High performance computing (HPC):} High-performance computing in distributed memory settings, where message communication is used instead of shared memory.
          \item \textbf{Clustered Computing:} Distributing CPU or I/O intensive tasks over multiple servers.
          \item \textbf{Cloud and Grid Computing:} Grid computing focuses on combining resources from different institutions, while cloud computing provides access to shared pools
          of configurable system resources.
          \item \textbf{Transaction Processing:} Distributed transactions coordinated by transaction processing (TP) monitor.
          \item \textbf{Enterprise Application Integration (EAI):} Middleware often used as communication facilitator in such systems.
          \item \textbf{Sensor Networks:} Each sensor in a network can process and store data, which can be queries by some operator. Sensors often rely on in-network data
          processing to reduce communication costs.
        \end{itemize}
